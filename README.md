A multi-threaded `wasm32-unknown-unknown` Web Audio
backend for [Firewheel](https://github.com/BillyDM/firewheel).

Currently, this backend only supports stereo inputs and outputs.

## Requirements

Because this crate relies on Wasm multi-threading, it has
some additional requirements.

1. A nightly compiler is required along with the Rust standard library source code
   (with `rustup`, you can add it with `rustup component add rust-src`).
2. You'll need the `atomics`, `bulk-memory`, and `mutable-globals` target features.
   These can be enabled with a `.cargo/config.toml`:

```toml
[target.wasm32-unknown-unknown]
rustflags = ["-C", "target-feature=+atomics,+bulk-memory,+mutable-globals"]

[unstable]
build-std = ["std", "core", "alloc", "panic_abort"]
```

3. Wherever your project is served, the protocol must be secure (usually `https`)
   and the response must include two security headers:

```
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
# or
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: credentialless
```

Note that `credentialless` may not work on Safari: the browser
may throw an error in the audio worklet upon receiving shared Wasm memory.
